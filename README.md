# Repository for Slides

A collection of slides and material from presentations, workshops, and lightning
talks given at the Linux-AG of the University of TÃ¼bingen.

## PDF Index

All slides can be viewed here: https://linux-ag.github.io/slides/

## Adding new Slides

Please create a new directory according to the existing scheme:
`$(date --iso-8601)_${SHORT_TITLE}`

We don't have any strict rules for the structure of the subdirectories (feel
free to add additional files).

If you can generate/export a PDF document it will be added to the PDF index if
you run `index.sh` (PDF documents that should not appear in the index shall be
put in a subdirectory of the subdirectory).

And feel free to assign a license to your work :)

## License

TODO, currently specified optionally per subdirectory.
